# Problem statement

build a predictive model to suggest the most suitable Crops to grow based on the available climate and soil condition

**Goal: Achieve Precision Farming by Optimizing the Agricultural Production.**

**DATASET**

The data set contains N- Nitrogen P- Potassium K- Phosphorus and the ph. levels and climate conditions temperature and humidity

### Model

the model uses K-mean clustering to find the clusters and find the grouping of similar crops.

**Logistic regression Model**

The data set is trained using the Logistic regression model and has an F1 score of 97.
